## Algos and Data Structure 

I am using this to keep track of my algos and data structure practice and for future reference.

Each problem coresponds to the number on Leetcode, and I try to give more than one solution and specify Big O so that I can force myselft to think about run time and space complexity when solving a problem and see if there are ways to optimize it.
